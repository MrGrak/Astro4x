Astro 4x TODO:








improved zooming in/out. improved cursor movement bounds.

swapped ice caps to have higher elevations.


fix the flood fill algorithm, it doesn't work for all tiles.
we also need to implement bounds so we dont grab tiles across
the other side of map.





create a world view, using rotating 2d

create a universe view, isometric

create transition between those views






barbarian huts
small civs that dont progress past 1st age, harder than barbs
roaming bandits (so we have threats late game too)

each race should have it's own bonuses
