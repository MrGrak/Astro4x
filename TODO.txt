Astro 4x TODO:






universe view/screen++


create astro sheet, which shows universe tiles.
get astro screen working in basic way.

figure out the transition between planet and astro views.
we should be able to zoom out to 0.5f for the universe view too.

we should be able to 'save' the universe, which includes generating
and binary writing many planets and stars within said universe.

we need to be able to generate stars, which are just white tiles,
that we can tint as needed (if star is blue, red, yellow, etc).

we need to be able to see and select stars and planets in
astro view. this should open the planet screen, showing the
planet zoom view, which we can further zoom into. zooming
out of the planet screen should just close it. we assume
the base screen is the universe screen, from now on.

zooming in, should open the planet screen, from astro view.









we need to add resources to tiles

this is additional columns under each tile type
so we have land type on X and resource subtype on Y
but we only have 1 tile to draw. we will need to increase
the size of tiles to be byte,byte with X,Y draw recs as bytes
we shouldn't need more than 256x256 land id types



resources affect food, production, research, or gold

mineral rich soil +2 food
hydrogen gas +2 food
oxygen gas +2 food

aluminum +2 production
uranium +2 production
titanium +2 production

gold +3 gold
silver +2 gold
copper +1 gold, +1 research

silicon +3 research
palladium +2 research
boron +1 research, +1 production

use apple, hammer, beaker, and gold bars to represent resources






improve world generation routines for all planet types
add more tile types to help fill out planet landscapes
rocky planets are pretty boring, for example
we also need more types of cold terrain for artic planets

dev menu screen++

we have buttons that represent tiles we can click on,
and then paint on the world via RMB. these tiles are
located underneath the save/load buttons. they can have
a text field to describe them too.
