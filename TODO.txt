Astro 4x TODO:

improve world generation routines for all planet types
add more tile types to help fill out planet landscapes
rocky planets are pretty boring, for example
we also need more types of cold terrain for artic planets
moon surfaces, for example, would be gray rock, so add those tiles
moons can be landed on and pillaged for resources, same size as planets

create planet view screen, which is central sprite with orbiting moons
we should be able to 'zoom out' to this planet view from land view

we have 4 different planet types we can display here
plus different star types






dev menu screen++

add a button to load world data from file

this should give us a file explorer to choose file from,
we select it, it populates the land tiles from data. ez.



we have buttons that represent tiles we can click on,
and then paint on the world via RMB. these tiles are
located underneath the save/load buttons. they can have
a text field to describe them too.

we should have all basic land tiles represented.



create a universe view, isometric
