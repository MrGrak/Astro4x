Astro 4x TODO:











instead of drawing black, draw the deep sea color as background,
this way we can hide the edges of the map better. done.


remove the tile edges/highlights. done.







improve landmass generation.
we want to have starting tiles that represent city locations,
which we could connect via roads (dirt tiles).

we need terrain control.




how do units look?

should we be zooming out fully? can we make this look
better? can we fix this with anti aliasing somehow?


create a world view, using rotating 2d

create a universe view, isometric

create transition between those views





barbarian huts
small civs that dont progress past 1st age, harder than barbs
roaming bandits (so we have threats late game too)

each race should have it's own bonuses
