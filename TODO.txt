swap zoomed out tiles to be 0 y axis
zoomed in is 1 on y axis. done.

try zooming out to 0.25 and see what it looks like
done, it looks great.





match the background draw to the planet type (which has a base color)
for the land screen






if we add a center vignette we can make the map look like
a planet. then we draw stars over the black background and
animate them








improve world generation routines for all planet types
add more tile types to help fill out planet landscapes
rocky planets are pretty boring, for example
we also need more types of cold terrain for artic planets

create planet view screen, which is central sprite with orbiting moons
we should be able to 'zoom out' to this planet view from land view

we have 4 different planet types we can display here
plus different star types






dev menu screen++

add a button to load world data from file

this should give us a file explorer to choose file from,
we select it, it populates the land tiles from data. ez.



we have buttons that represent tiles we can click on,
and then paint on the world via RMB. these tiles are
located underneath the save/load buttons. they can have
a text field to describe them too.

we should have all basic land tiles represented.



create a universe view, isometric
