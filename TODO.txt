Astro 4x TODO:



we want to highlight the current tile under cursor with a
special sprite highlight, which we can draw in any color,
so make it white in the sheet. draw it sorted over the tile
currently under the cursor. we no longer alter the height,
because we need to control that in generation.


make highlight tile half alpha


add selected tile sprite

when we right click a tile, set it as selected, zoom camera
into it, as focus.







create a world view, using rotating 2d

create a universe view, isometric

create transition between those views






barbarian huts
small civs that dont progress past 1st age, harder than barbs
roaming bandits (so we have threats late game too)

each race should have it's own bonuses
