develop a 3d perspective using 2d grid

how do units look?

should we be zooming out fully? can we make this look
better? can we fix this with anti aliasing somehow?






create a world view, using rotating 2d

create a universe view, isometric

create transition between those views






barbarian huts
small civs that dont progress past 1st age, harder than barbs
roaming bandits (so we have threats late game too)

each race should have it's own bonuses
